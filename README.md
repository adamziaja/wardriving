This is my first (structural - "_why make it simple when you can make it complicated?_") PHP script, created in 2010-2011. The script parses [Kismet](http://kismetwireless.net) logs to a database and shows collected data on a website with, inter alia, interactive and static maps of wireless networks using [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org) with [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org), [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com) and [UMP-pcPL](http://ump.waw.pl). The project's language is Polish.

Feel free to use this code and please just credit me (Adam Ziaja http://adamziaja.com). If you want to use most of this code then please take care to change static set passwords!

I would like to thank [Patrick Salecker](http://www.salecker.org) from [wardriving-forum.de](http://wardriving-forum.de) and all the people from #wardriving at [QuakeNet](http://www.quakenet.org).

Wardriving is not illegal in any form in Poland. Wardriving is not hacking of wireless networks. Wardriving has nothing to do with unauthorized use of any kind. Wardriving is not a crime!
